At the far end of the 19th century, in the age of Jack the Ripper, and 80 years after <name>Frankenstein</name> (No 8 in this series), <name>Dracula</name> is a classic of gothic horror by an Irish contemporary of <name>Oscar Wilde</name> who wrote popular fiction to boost his income. Like <name>Mary Shelley</name>'s tale of the supernatural, the vampire tale of <name>Dracula</name> – partly derived from <name>John Polidori</name>'s The Vampyre (1819) and Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla (1871), about a lesbian vampire – may also have begun with a bad dream. Just as <name>Mary</name> was partly motivated by Byron and her husband, the poet <name>Shelley</name>, so <name>Bram Stoker</name>, the business manager for the Lyceum theatre, was inspired by his devoted service to the Great Shakespearean actor <name>Henry Irving</name>.
