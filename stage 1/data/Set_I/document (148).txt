<name>Pitcher</name>, confidential clerk in the office of <name>Harvey Maxwell</name>, broker, allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer. With a snappy "Good-morning, <name>Pitcher</name>," <name>Maxwell</name> dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him.

The young lady had been <name>Maxwell</name>'s stenographer for a year. She was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic. 

<name>Pitcher</name>, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this morning. Instead of going straight into the adjoining room, where her desk was, she lingered, slightly irresolute, in the outer office. Once she moved over by <name>Maxwell</name>'s desk, near enough for him to be aware of her presence.
