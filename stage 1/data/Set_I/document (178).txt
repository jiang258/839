If you had seen little <name>Jo</name> standing at the street corner in the rain, you would hardly have admired him. It was apparently an ordinary autumn rainstorm, but the water which fell upon <name>Jo</name> (who was hardly old enough to be either just or unjust, and so perhaps did not come under the law of impartial distribution) appeared to have some property peculiar to itself: one would have said it was dark and adhesive -- sticky. 

Of quite another kind, though equally 'out of the common,' was the incident of <name>Hetty Parlow</name>'s ghost. <name>Hetty Parlow</name>'s maiden name had been <name>Brownon</name>, and in Blackburg that meant more than one would think.
