Little Mrs. <name>Sommers</name> one day found herself the unexpected possessor of fifteen dollars. It seemed to her a very large amount of money, and the way in which it stuffed and bulged her worn old porte-monnaie gave her a feeling of importance such as she had not enjoyed for years.


A dollar or two should be added to the price usually paid for <name>Janie</name>'s shoes, which would insure their lasting an appreciable time longer than they usually did. She would buy so and so many yards of percale for new shirt waists for the boys and <name>Janie</name> and <name>Mag</name>. She had intended to make the old ones do by skilful patching.
