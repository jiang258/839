 I turned round, and saw <name>Lord Murchison</name>.I found him a good deal changed. He looked anxious and puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something. I felt it could not be modern scepticism, for <name>Murchison</name> was the stoutest of <name>Tories</name>, and believed in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was married yet.


'My dear <name>Gerald</name>,' I said, 'women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.'


'I believe you have a mystery in your life, <name>Gerald</name>,' I exclaimed; 'tell me about it.'
