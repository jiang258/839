The widow of <name>Paolo Saverini</name> lived alone with her son in a poor little house on the outskirts of Bonifacio. 

The house of widow <name>Saverini</name>, clinging to the very edge of the precipice, looks out, through its three windows, over this wild and desolate picture.

She lived there alone, with her son <name>Antonia</name> and their dog "<name>Semillante</name>," a big, thin beast, with a long rough coat, of the sheep-dog breed. The young man took her with him when out hunting.
