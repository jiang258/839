There are other heroines to whom history has paid more attention, and whose deeds have been celebrated in song and story; but not one of them was more devoted to the high cause of freedom, or more courageous, or depended less on aid from others, than Aunt <name>Nancy Hart</name>. Invention and fable have kindly come to the aid of the most famous of the world's heroines, but neither fable nor invention has touched the character or the deeds of this heroine of the Revolution.

Before passing upon it, we should have to know what the War Woman's eyes had seen, and what terrible revelations her ears had heard. Standing for american independence in a region that swarmed with <name>Tories</name>, whose murderous deeds never have been and never will be fully set forth, Aunt <name>Nancy Hart</name> had to defend her own hearthstone and her own children.
