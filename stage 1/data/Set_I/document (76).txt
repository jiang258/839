I first read <name>Toni Morrison</name> in 1977 when a proof copy of her novel, Song of Solomon, was on offer to the then-independent publisher, <name>Chatto & Windus</name>, for whom I was working as a young editor. Part of my background reading for this, her third book, involved discovering, and falling in love with, her debut, The Bluest Eye (1970), and its successor, Sula (1973). Since then, I have followed most of <name>Morrison</name>’s subsequent fiction, notably Beloved and Jazz, but I remain a diehard fan of the novel that established her name. 

Song of Solomon takes off, and finally comes back to earth, with an exhilarating leap of danger. The idea of “fly” and “flight” (as an escape, or challenge) runs through the story of <name>Macon</name>, who gets his nickname from being breastfed into childhood by his dominant mother.
