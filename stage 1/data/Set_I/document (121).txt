Knowing that Mrs. <name>Mallard</name> was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.

It was her sister <name>Josephine</name> who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend <name>Richards</name> was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with <name>Brently Mallard</name>'s name leading the list of "killed." He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.
