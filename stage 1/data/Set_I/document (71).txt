<name>Stella Gibbons</name>, who was born in the same year as <name>Georgette Heyer</name> and <name>Stevie Smith</name>, 1902, wrote more than 20 novels, and thought of herself as a poet. But she continues to be remembered, and in some quarters revered, for just one title, a jeu d’esprit that’s a brilliant parody of an inter-war genre of provincial, rural melodrama typified (at the high end) by <name>DH Lawrence</name> and, much lower down, by <name>Mary Webb</name>.

<name>Gibbons</name> wrote Cold Comfort Farm while working for on the books pages of the Lady. Inspired, or perhaps provoked, by the fashion for novels set in remote rustic villages about sensitive young men with names like “Micah”, she set about demolishing a piece of treasured literary real estate whose origins can be traced to the late-Victorian novels of <name>Thomas Hardy</name>.
