When, for instance, in 1873, the poet <name>Emily Dickinson</name> referred to the novel, she wrote in a letter: What do I think of middlemarch? What do I think of glory â€“ except that in a few instances.

According to <name>Virginia Woolf</name>, it is "one of the few English novels written for grown-up people". Later in the 20th century the influential critic FR Leavis made middlemarch a central element of his "Great Tradition". Today it stands as perhaps the greatest of many great Victorian novels.

<name>George Eliot</name>'s masterpiece, middlemarch, appeared after the deaths of <name>Thackeray</name> (1863) and <name>Dickens</name> (1870). This is hardly an accident. Subtitled "a study of provincial life", the novel has a didactic realism that's a world away from Vanity Fair or great expectations. Indeed, middlemarch looms above the mid-Victorian literary landscape like a cathedral of words in whose shadowy vastness its readers can find every kind of addictive discomfort, a sequence of raw truths: the loneliness of the disappointed failure, Dr <name>Lydgate</name>; the frustrations of his discontented wife; the humiliation of a good woman, <name>Dorothea</name>; the corrosive bitterness of Casaubon, and so on.
