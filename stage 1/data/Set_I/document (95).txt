"Hi, this is <name>Alexis</name> at the Parents League. I'm just calling to follow up on the uniform guidelines we sent over . .." The blond woman volunteering behind the reception desk holds up a bejeweled finger, signaling me to wait while she continues on the phone. "Yes, well, this year we'd really like to see all your girls in longer skirts, at least twenty inches. We're still getting complaints from the mothers at the boys' schools in the vicinity... Great. Good to hear it. Bye." With a grand gesture she crosses the word "Spence" off her list of three items.

"Hi," I say. "I'm <name>Nan</name>. Actually, I took care of the Oleason girls. I think they lived next door-to you."

She arches an eyebrow to give me a once-over. "Oh... Oh, <name>Nanny</name>, that's right," she confirms for herself, before retreating back to her desk.
