In his Paris review interview with <name>DeLillo</name>, <name>Adam Begley</name> prefaces the conversation with a vivid note that conjures the experience of meeting <name>DeLillo</name>. <name>Begley</name> writes: “A man who’s been called ‘the chief shaman of the paranoid school of American fiction’ can be expected to act a little nervous. I met <name>Don DeLillo</name> for the first time in an Irish restaurant in Manhattan, for a conversation he said would be ‘deeply preliminary’. He is a slender man, grey-haired, with boxy brown glasses. His eyes, magnified by thick lenses, are restless without being shifty. He looks to the right, to the left; he turns his head to see what’s behind him.”
