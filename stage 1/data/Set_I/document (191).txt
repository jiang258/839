IN spite of a violent attack of gout in the night and the nervous exhaustion left by it, <name>Kistunov</name> went in the morning to his office and began punctually seeing the clients of the bank and persons who had come with petitions. He looked languid and exhausted, and spoke in a faint voice hardly above a whisper, as though he were dying.

The petitioner was blinking, and dived into her mantle for her handkerchief. <name>Kistunov</name> took her petition from her and began reading it.
