At lunch next day there were very nice pies, crayfish, and mutton cutlets; and while we were eating, <name>Nikanor</name>, the cook, came up to ask what the visitors would like for dinner. He was a man of medium height, with a puffy face and little eyes; he was close-shaven, and it looked as though his moustaches had not been shaved, but had been pulled out by the roots. <name>Alehin</name> told us that the beautiful <name>Pelagea</name> was in love with this cook. Whenever he got drunk she used to hide upstairs and sob, and on such occasions <name>Alehin</name> and the servants stayed in the house to be ready to defend her in case of necessity.
