"Whom have I the honor of addressing?" asked the inspector.

"<name>Psyekoff</name>, <name>Lieutenant Klausoff</name>'s agent; agriculturist and mechanician!"

The inspector and his deputy, on visiting the scene of the occurrence in company with <name>Psyekoff</name>, found the following: Near the wing in which <name>Klausoff</name> had lived was gathered a dense crowd. The news of the murder had sped swift as lightning through the neighborhood, and the peasantry, thanks to the fact that the day was a holiday, had hurried together from all the neighboring villages. There was much commotion and talk. Here and there, pale, tear-stained faces were seen. The door of <name>Klausoff</name>'s bedroom was found locked. The key was inside.
