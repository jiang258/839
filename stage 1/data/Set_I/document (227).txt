But Prince <name>Prospero</name> was happy and dauntless and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated, he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court, and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his crenellated abbeys. This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the prince's own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts.

It was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion that the Prince <name>Prospero</name> entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence.
