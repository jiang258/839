These are the great truths of modern life which <name>Hughie Erskine</name> never realised. Poor Mr. <name>Hughie</name>! Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. He was as popular with men as he was with women, and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword, and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. Mr. <name>Hughie</name> hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf between <name>Ruff</name>'s Guide and <name>Bailey</name>'s Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. He had tried everything.
