We look down upon a crowded amphitheatre. Out of the "Clouds" of <name>Aristophanes</name>, satire and humor are pouring down in streams upon the audience; on the stage <name>Socrates</name>, the most remarkable man in Athens, he who had been the shield and defence of the people against the thirty tyrants, is held up mentally and bodily to ridicule—<name>Socrates</name>, who saved <name>Alcibiades</name> and <name>Xenophon</name> in the turmoil of battle, and whose genius soared far above the gods of the ancients. He himself is present; he has risen from the spectator's bench, and has stepped forward, that the laughing Athenians may well appreciate the likeness between himself and the caricature on the stage. There he stands before them, towering high above them all.
