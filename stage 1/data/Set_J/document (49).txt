“<name>Laura Palfrey</name>,” writes <name>Elizabeth Taylor</name>, in a brilliant, character-defining sentence at the opening of her masterpiece, “would have made a distinguished-looking man and, sometimes, wearing evening dress, looked like some famous general in drag.”

Mrs <name>Palfrey</name>, recently widowed, arrives at the Claremont hotel on the Cromwell Road, one rainy Sunday in January. She is asserting her right to be herself after years as a colonial wife, while also acknowledging the inevitability of decline and death. “It was hard work being old,” writes <name>Taylor</name>. “Both infancy and age are tiring times.”

When she subjects the newest resident of the Claremont to that classic geriatric indignity, a fall, the upshot is not humiliation, but romance. <name>Ludo Myers</name> is a struggling writer who rescues Mrs <name>Palfrey</name> and becomes, through a series of misunderstandings, her grandson “Desmond”.
