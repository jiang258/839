The police superintendent <name>Otchumyelov</name> is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.

"So you bite, you damned brute?" <name>Otchumyelov</name> hears suddenly. "Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! ah . . . ah!"

There is the sound of a dog yelping. <name>Otchumyelov</name> looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of <name>Pitchugin</name>'s timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her.
