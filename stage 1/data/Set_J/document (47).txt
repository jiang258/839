"<name>George</name>, I wish you'd look at the nursery."
"Well," said <name>George Hadley</name>.
They  stood  on the  thatched floor of the nursery. It  was  forty feet across by forty feet long and thirty feet high;  it had cost half  again as much as the rest  of the house. "But nothing's  too good for  our children," <name>George</name> had said.
The nursery was  silent. It was  empty  as a jungle  glade at  hot high noon. The  walls were blank  and two dimensional.  Now, as <name>George</name> and <name>Lydia Hadley</name> stood in  the center of the room, the walls  began to purr and recede into  crystalline  distance,  it  seemed, and  presently  an  African  veldt appeared, in three  dimensions, on  all  sides, in color  reproduced to  the final pebble and bit of straw. The ceiling above them became a deep sky with a hot yellow sun.
