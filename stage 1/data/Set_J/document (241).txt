By a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. The boy was called <name>Hansel</name> and the girl <name>Gretel</name>. He had little to bite and to break, and once, when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.
The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father. <name>Gretel</name> wept bitter tears, and said to <name>Hansel</name>, "Now all is over with us."
