THE man whose story is here to be told was the wealthiest and most influential person in his parish; his name was <name>Thord Overaas</name>. He appeared in the priest's study one day, tall and earnest. "I have gotten a son," said he, "and I wish to present him for baptism."



"<name>Finn</name>,â€”after my father."



They were mentioned, and proved to be the best men and women of <name>Thord</name>'s relations in the parish.


Then the priest rose. "There is yet this, however," said he, and walking toward <name>Thord</name>, he took him by the hand and looked gravely into his eyes: "God grant that the child may become a blessing to you!"



"I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son; he is about to marry <name>Karen Storliden</name>, daughter of <name>Gudmund</name>, who stands here beside me."


A fortnight later, the father and son were rowing across the lake, one calm, still day, to <name>Storliden</name> to make arrangements for the wedding.
