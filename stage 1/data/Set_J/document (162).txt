Concerning this resemblance between sheep, there is a story told of a fat old Murrumbidgee squatter who gave a big price for a famous ram called Sir <name>Oliver</name>. He took a friend out one day to inspect Sir <name>Oliver</name>, and overhauled that animal with a most impressive air of sheep-wisdom.

Bare-bellied as a pig, compared with Sir <name>Oliver</name>. Not that this isn't a fair sheep, but he'd be dear at one-tenth Sir <name>Oliver</name>'s price. By the way, <name>Johnson</name>" (to his overseer), "what ram IS this?"
