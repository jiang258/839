One morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons lived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, <name>Alan Trevor</name>. <name>Trevor</name> was a painter. Indeed, few people escape that nowadays. But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare. Personally he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard. However, when he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after. He had been very much attracted by Mr. <name>Hughie</name> at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm. However, after he got to know Mr. <name>Hughie</name> better, he liked him quite as much for his bright buoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature, and had given him the permanent entree to his studio.
