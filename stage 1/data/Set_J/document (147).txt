On a warm summer day, villagers gather in a town square to participate in a lottery. The village is small with about 300 residents, and they are in an excited but anxious mood. We learn that this is an annual event and that some surrounding towns are thinking about abandoning the lottery. Mrs. <name>Hutchinson</name> makes an undramatic entrance and chats briefly with Mrs. <name>Delacroix</name>, her friend.

The night before Mr. <name>Summers</name>, a town leader who officiates the lottery, had made paper slips listing all the families with the help of Mr. <name>Graves</name> (subtle name choice?). The slips were stored overnight in a safe at the coal company.
