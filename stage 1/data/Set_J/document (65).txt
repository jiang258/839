The story line for the split cherry is quite simple and they nailed it at Wikipedia, "In this story, a high school teacher in a one-room schoolhouse keeps a boy after school to work and pay for damage he did to a cherry tree. The boy's uneducated father comes to school to argue with the teacher, but comes to appreciate the value of higher education." The main characters are the boy, <name>Dave Sexton</name>, the teacher, Professor <name>Herbert</name>, and <name>Dave</name>'s father <name>Luster Sexton</name>.

I don't mind staying after school," I says to Professor <name>Herbert</name>, "but I'd rather you'd whip me with a switch and let me go home early. <name>Pa</name> will whip me anyway for getting home two hours late."
