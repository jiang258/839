The man's name was said to be <name>Murlock</name>. He was apparently seventy years old, actually about fifty. Something besides years had had a hand in his aging. 

One day <name>Murlock</name> was found in his cabin, dead. It was not a time and place for coroners and newspapers, and I suppose it was agreed that he had died from natural causes or I should have been told, and should remember. 

When <name>Murlock</name> built his cabin and began laying sturdily about with his ax to hew out a farm--the rifle, meanwhile, his means of support--he was young, strong and full of hope.
