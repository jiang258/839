# 839-stage-data  
In this stage, we plan to extract names from documents.  
All of our data are short stories from internet, which may from different origin and author. We suffered a alot from this kind of data and decide to write it down here to tell everybody who sees this page, that make sure to always use the well structured data, or you will fee like us in the end.  
The data are labeled like \<name>...\</name>  
There are 1340 names in 300 files, 887 of which are in Set I and 453 of which are in Set J.
